Robot Framework Demo
============
I can talk for hours about the virtues and elegance of Robot Framework! But if a picture is worth a 1,000 words, how much better is an actual demonstration?

Here's the official site: https://robotframework.org/

This project will demonstrate simple tests for both a REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) endpoint and a UI (User Interface).  

# Prerequisites

    1. git
    2. docker
* Optional
    1. Python3
